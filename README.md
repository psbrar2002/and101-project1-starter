## Notes
In this unit I was able to familiarize myself with Android Studio and recall how git works as the last time I got to use git was for a Data Structures assignment a while ago. I also learned how to utilize an emulator and view code through design and so much more it was so interesting to see. I was also able to learn a bit more about UI customization and Kotlin overall.
